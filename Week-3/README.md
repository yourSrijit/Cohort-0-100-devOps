## 1. Middleware
Middleware is software that acts as a bridge between different applications or systems, facilitating communication and data management. In web development, middleware often intercepts incoming HTTP requests and provides additional functionality before passing them on to the main application.

### Example:
In an Express.js application, middleware functions are used to perform tasks such as authentication, logging, or error handling. Here's a simple example of how middleware works in Express:
```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware function to log incoming requests
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`[${new Date().toISOString()}] ${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next(); // Pass control to the next middleware function
});

// Route handler
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, world!');
});

// Middleware function for error handling
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});


```
In this example:

The first middleware function logs the timestamp, HTTP method, and URL of every incoming request.
The route handler responds with "Hello, world!" when the root URL is accessed.
The second middleware function is an error handler that logs any errors and sends a generic error message with a 500 status code.
Middleware allows developers to modularize and organize code more efficiently by separating concerns and adding reusable functionality to their applications.
